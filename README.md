# Implement-a-server-capable-of-performing-few-defined-GET-and-PULL-request
- Exposes a GET API as "api/request?connId=19&amp;timeout=80"    This API will keep the request running for provided time on the server side. After   the successful completion of the provided time it should return {"status":"ok"}     - Exposes a GET API as "api/serverStatus"    This API returns all the running requests on the server with their time left for   completion. E.g {"2":"15","8":"10"} where 2 and 8 are the connIds and 15 and 10   is the time remaining for the requests to complete (in seconds).     - Exposes a PUT API as "api/kill" with payload as {"connId":12}   This API will finish the running request with provided connId, so that the finished   request returns {"status":"killed"} and the current request will return   {"status":"ok"}. If no running request found with the provided connId on the server   then the current request should return "status":"invalid connection Id : &lt;connId>"}
